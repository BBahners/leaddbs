Pre- (and post-) operative acquisitions were spatially normalized into PD25_MNI space (Xiao 2017) based on preoperative acquisition(s) (anat_pca.nii, anat_fa.nii, anat_pd.nii, anat_t2.nii, anat_t1.nii) using the SyN registration approach as implemented in Advanced Normalization Tools (Avants 2008; http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/). Nonlinear deformation into template space was achieved in five stages: After two linear (rigid followed by affine) steps,  A nonlinear (whole brain) SyN-registration stage was followed by two nonlinear SyN-registrations that consecutively focused on the area of interest  as defined by subcortical masks in Schoenecker 2008.
