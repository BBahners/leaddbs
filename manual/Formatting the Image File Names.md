## Renaming the Image Files

_Lead-DBS_ can process different image views. However, the image files must have a specific name format for them to be recognized.

**MR imaging** files within each folder must have the following format:
- Pre-operative images:
 - `pre_tra.nii` for transversal images
 - `pre_cor.nii` for coronal images
 - `pre_sag.nii` for sagittal images
 - `*.nii`for fiber tracking images

- Post-operative images:
 - `tra.nii` for transversal images
 - `cor.nii` for coronal images
 - `sag.nii` for sagittal images

**CT imaging** files within each folder must have the following format:

- Pre-operative images:
 - `pre.nii`
- Post-operative images:
 - `fusion.nii`

The user can download the program [MRIcron](http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/mricro/mricron/) to view the different image files and help in correct naming.
