## Installation

_Lead-DBS_ is a toolbox that depends on [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.de/products/matlab/) ([The Mathworks](http://www.mathworks.com/)), thus requiring no installation onto the operating system.

However, there are some required steps prior to using the toolbox:

1. After downloading the folder containing _Lead-DBS_, the user must set a path in MATLAB for the toolbox folder (for help on setting a path in MATLAB, go to **Section 1.1**).
2. The user must download and incorporate atlases into the _Lead-DBS_ directory (for more details on this step, refer to **Section 1.2**).
3. The user must have _SPM_ available in the MATLAB directory.

Once the path is set and the atlases are installed, the user can run _Lead-DBS_ by entering the command `lead` into the MATLAB Command Window.
