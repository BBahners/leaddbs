## Writing 2D Images

After a successful reconstruction, you can obtain 2D transversal images of each contact in its location within the brain tissue. To select this option, the box `[] Write out 2D` must be checked within the _Lead-DBS_ main window.

The 2D images are created using the localization settings obtained in the reconstruction and the manual correction. They help to better understand how the electrode contacts relate to the surrounding brain structures.

#### Features within the Images

Certain features can be selected to enhance the understanding of the structures surrounding the contacts:

- Color:
 Brain areas are or the contour
Bounding box: how big the image is in the end
