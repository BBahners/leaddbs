# Manual Selection of Entry Points

When the option `Manual` is chosen from the `Entry point for electrodes` dropdown menu, the user will be required to select a point in an image where the electrode lead might be located. The artifact is easily recognizable because of its contrast to the surrounding tissue. This selection has to be done for each hemisphere. Please always select the artifact that is present on the side where the red square is presented. If you would reverse the order, the left/right electrodes get mixed up in further steps.

Options within `Axis` and `Mask window size` can also be changed to improve the reconstruction.

After clicking a point in the image, _Lead-DBS_ will run the reconstruction algorithm.
