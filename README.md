LEAD-DBS
========

LEAD-DBS is a MATLAB-toolbox facilitating the: 

- reconstruction of deep-brain-stimulation (DBS) electrodes in the human brain on basis of postoperative MRI and/or CT imaging
- the visualization of localization results in 2D/3D
- a group-analysis of DBS-electrode placement results and their effects on clinical results
- simulation of DBS stimulations (calculation of volume of activated tissue â€“ VAT)
- diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based connectivity estimates and fiber-tracking from the VAT to other brain regions (connectomic surgery)

LEAD-DBS builds on SPM8/12, especially regarding warping and segmentation procedures.
